Hi all,
This is a linear regression model.Please note the following points before having a look at it.
      1)Demand  is a dependent variable and it is time series dependent.Hence,extra features are added as an effort for improving model 
         performance.
      2)Demand is not normally distributed,so,it is converted into normal distribution by taking log.
      3)Root Mean squared error=0.38
      4)RMSLE=0.3560
      5)I have tried my best to provide comments in the code for better understanding.
      
Please note that,This project is developed as a practice by me.Hence,I have referred various resources.
