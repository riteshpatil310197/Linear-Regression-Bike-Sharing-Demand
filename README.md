Hi all,
This is a linear regression model.Please note the following points before having a look at it.
      1)Demand  is a dependent variable and it is time series dependent.Hence,extra features are added as an effort for improving model 
         performance.
      2)Demand is not normally distributed,so,it is converted into normal distribution by taking log.
      3)Root Mean squared error=0.38
      4)RMSLE=0.3560
      5)I have tried my best to provide comments in the code for better understanding.
      
Please note that,This project is developed as a practice by me.Hence,I have referred various resources.      

## Linear Reagression:
Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: (1) does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?  (2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?  These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the formula y = c + b*x, where y = estimated dependent variable score, c = constant, b = regression coefficient, and x = score on the independent variable..
